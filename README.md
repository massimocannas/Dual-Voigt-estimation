# Dual-Voigt-estimation

This repository contains R code for the paper "On the Voigt profile and its dual". 📄 [see the pre-print in arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.13252)

The code in `dualvoigt estimation mom and mle` implements Method of Moments and likelihood-based estimation.

The code in `plot_sample_dualvoigt` contains functions for sampling and plotting (static plot files are included)

Finally, the file `dualvoigt_smooth`shows an animation of the Dual Voigt density for $\gamma=\sigma$ in $[0.25, 2]$
