# Dual-Voigt-estimation
R code for parameter estimation of the Dual Voigt distribution (Communications in Statistics – Theory and Methods, forthcoming)

The code in `dualvoigt estimation mom and mle` implements Method of Moments and likelihood-based estimation.

The code in `plot_sample_dualvoigt` contains functions for sampling and plotting (static plot files are included)

Finally, the file `dualvoigt_smooth`shows an animation of the Dual Voigt density.
